# Update

2022.06.23.

The related paper “Intrinsic and Isotropic Resampling for 3D Point Clouds” has been accepted in TPAMI. 

2021.08.19, Version 0.2.

We upload the program into EXE folder which has been compiled. You can use .exe to test our resampling method directly without any complex configurations. 

2021.01.21, Version 0.1.

The I&I resampling framework for point cloud resampling and mesh reconstruction.

For this version, the geodesic coodinate system is not added into the framework. We use a AIVS method (another work to provide an appximate intrinsic control in simplification) in this version. In futher work, we will upload new codes with full functions.
