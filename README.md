# I&I Resampling

2021.01.21, Version 0.1.

The I&I resampling framework for point cloud resampling and mesh reconstruction.

For this version, the geodesic coodinate system is not added into the framework. We use a AIVS method (another work to provide an appximate intrinsic control in simplification) in this version. In futher work, we will upload new codes with full functions.
